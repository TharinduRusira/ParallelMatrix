## Executing Compiled Program

In order to run compiled code you need to give arguments
matrix multiplication version and the dimension of the square matrix.

### Running Serial Version with dimension 1000
./lab4 serial 1000

### Running Parallel Version with dimension 1000
./lab4 parallel 1000

### Running Optimized Version with dimension 1000
./lab4 optmized 1000

### Determing Number of iterations to get runtimes within an accuracy of Â±5% and 95% confidence level
use lab4_stats.py script

example
------------
python lab4_stats.py --run_command="./lab4 parallel 1000" with execute matrix multiplication with
default of 5 iterations and give average, standard deviation and required number of iterations

then again run with n iterations to get the average
python lab4_stats.py --run_command="./lab4 parallel 1000" --iterations=n
